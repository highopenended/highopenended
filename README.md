## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt and I am a new software engineer whose passion is applying my programming skills to make everyday tasks easier. I have always loved making little tools/apps for my friends and all of it was self-taught, so the shift into an actual career was a natural evolution.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working through the Bloomtech full stack program
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and I have a high level of experience with C# and VBA
